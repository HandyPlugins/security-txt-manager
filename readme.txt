Create and manage your security.txt from within WordPress. The easiest way to manage security policy.

== Description ==

This powerful yet user-friendly WordPress plugin enables you to create, edit, and manage your "security.txt" file directly from the WordPress dashboard. As one of the most critical files on any site, the "security.txt" file communicates your security policy and contact information to security researchers.

=== What is security.txt? ===

A proposed standard which allows websites to define security policies.

[Read the RFC](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9116)

===  Can I use this with multisite? ===

Yes! However, if you are using a subfolder installation it will only work for the main site. This is because you can only have one `security.txt` for a given domain or subdomain per the [security.txt spec](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9116#section-3.1).


=== Technical Notes ===

* Requires PHP 7.2+.
* Requires WordPress 5.7+.
* Rewrites need to be enabled. Without rewrites, WordPress cannot know to supply `/security.txt` when requested.
* Your site URL must not contain a path (e.g. `https://example.com/site/` or path-based multisite installs). [Learn more on spec](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9116#section-3.1).
